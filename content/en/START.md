  - You can fork and clone [metarhia/Template](https://github.com/metarhia/Template) to your machine
  - Alternatively you can fork and clone [metarhia/Example](https://github.com/metarhia/Example)
  - Also you can create new repo and add initial files and folder manually
- Use `npm i` to install dependencies in development environment or `npm i --omit=dev` for production
- Start the server: `node server.js`
