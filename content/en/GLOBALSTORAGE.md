## 🚀 PWA (Progressive Web App)

Web apps with UX close to native: offline mode, installation, fast loading. PWAs help when connectivity is poor or networks are slow by combining strengths of web and native platforms.

## 🔀 Sync Engine

## CRDT (Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types)

Data structures that enable automatic conflict resolution in distributed systems. CRDTs simplify synchronization and concurrent editing, enabling offline-first applications without data loss or conflicts.

## ↔️ CAS Containers (Compare-And-Swap)

An atomic concurrency mechanism that stores records protected by hashes or versions. CAS containers help avoid race conditions and concurrent modification conflicts, ensuring data consistency and enabling optimistic concurrency control.

## 🗃️ IndexedDB (browser built-in database)

Client-side database API for transactional storage of structured data in browsers. IndexedDB provides offline persistence, local querying, caching, and support for building b-tree indexes.

## 🧊 Blockchain (without mining)

Distributed ledger providing immutable history and strong integrity guarantees. Used for decentralized databases where immutability, transparency, and trust are required.

- [Code examples](https://github.com/HowProgrammingWorks/Blockchain)

## 🤖 Bot Engine

## 🏃 JavaScript Smart Contracts

Business logic executed in JavaScript within decentralized environments. Solves automation and trust issues related to data changes, ensures automatic enforcement of agreements, and secure code execution.

## 🔌 WebSocket

Protocol for real-time, two-way data exchange over a single TCP connection. WebSocket reduces latency and enables interactive near-real-time applications.
